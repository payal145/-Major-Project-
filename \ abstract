Abstract
 The rapid expansion of digital news platforms over recent years has re
sulted in an unprecedented surge in the volume and variety of information
 available online. Every minute, thousands of news articles, reports, and
 updates are published across diverse domains such as government affairs,
 healthcare, education, crime, business, and more. While this abundance of
 information can be valuable, it also poses a significant challenge: manually
 monitoring and analyzing this continuous flow of real-time news is not only
 time-consuming but also highly prone to human error. For government
 departments, corporate entities, media analysts, and other stakeholders,
 keeping track of relevant news stories and extracting actionable insights
 has become increasingly difficult.
 To address this critical need, the project introduces an AI-powered News
 Monitoring System designed to automate and streamline the process of
 collecting, classifying, and analyzing online news articles in real-time. The
 primary objective of the system is to classify incoming news content into
 relevant government or organizational departments such as Education,
 Health, Crime, Finance, Environment, and others. This categorization
 allows decision-makers to focus specifically on information that impacts
 their domain, thereby improving efficiency and situational awareness.
 In addition to classification, the system performs sentiment analysis on news
 articles to gauge the public’s mood or perception towards specific events
 or departments. By categorizing sentiments into Positive, Neutral, and
 Negative classes, the system provides a nuanced understanding of public
 opinion, enabling organizations to respond proactively to shifts in sentiment,
 especially when negative or critical news arises.
 The technological foundation of the system leverages state-of-the-art Natu
v
ral Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models
 to achieve high accuracy and robustness. Among these techniques, Dis
tilBERT—a lightweight and efficient variant of the BERT transformer
 model—is utilized for capturing deep semantic relationships within text
 data, even across multiple languages. This makes the system highly effective
 for processing multilingual news sources. Complementing this, traditional
 methods like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) are
 employed for feature extraction, and Logistic Regression serves as a reliable
 classifier, ensuring a balance between computational efficiency and predic
tion performance.
 An essential component of the solution is its comprehensive web scraping
 pipeline. This module continuously gathers news articles from a wide range
 of online sources including news portals, blogs, government websites, and
 social media platforms. The scraping mechanism supports multiple lan
guages, enabling real-time ingestion and processing of diverse news content
 from across the globe.
 One of the project’s key innovations is the Sentiment-Based Alerting Mech
anism. This feature is designed to flag news articles with negative or critical
 sentiments that pertain to specific departments. When such articles are
 detected, the system automatically generates alerts for relevant stakeholders.
 This functionality is crucial for early identification of potential crises or
 reputational risks, allowing timely interventions and decision-making.
 The backend infrastructure is developed using Python and the Django web
 framework, providing a scalable and secure environment to host the appli
cation and manage data workflows. Machine learning models are trained
 on curated multilingual datasets, ensuring the system’s adaptability and
 effectiveness in handling diverse news formats and languages.
 Overall, the AI-powered News Monitoring System empowers government
 agencies, corporations, and media analysts to maintain continuous situa
tional awareness by automating the otherwise tedious task of news moni
toring. It facilitates department-wise media reputation tracking, enables
 efficient sentiment evaluation, and supports proactive crisis management
